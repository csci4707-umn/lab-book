# Lab 3

## Introduction

In this lab, you should work on a **clean, unmodified** installation of PostgreSQL.

You will play with PostgreSQL as a black box. You will not be required to write code or modify anything in the PostgreSQL. Instead, you will do some experiments with large dataset and study the performance of different indexing structures. If you need to re-install PostgreSQL, follow the installation in [Setup PostgreSQL](./setup.md).

## Outline
In this lab, you need to finish the [lab report](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/291023/files/28057621?wrap=1) while doing the following steps:
1. Download and import the data. See [6.1](./lab3-1.md)
2. Do test on single table lookup performance. See [6.2](./lab3-2.md)
3. Do test on joining performance. See [6.3](./lab3-3.md)
4. Submit a **PDF** for your lab report.
