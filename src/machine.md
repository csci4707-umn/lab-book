# Connect to CSE Lab machines

All projects should be able to run on any CSE UNIX/Linux lab machines.

You should have an active CSE Labs Account and be able to connect to the machines. If not, please connect TA **ASAP**. 

We recommend to work on the machines listed on this [page](https://cse.umn.edu/cseit/classrooms-labs), for example `csel-kh1250-01.cselabs.umn.edu`. VOLE is **NOT** recommended for the lab works.

You are free to use any terminal/editor/IDE. I personally recommend to use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all labs, as it provides a built-in terminal and allows you to edit files remotely. You can learn how to set up remote editing for VS Code on this [page](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kauffman/tutorials/unix-environment.html#org07b4b9f)[^1].
