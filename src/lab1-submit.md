# Lab 1 Submit Guidance

> Do **NOT** post your project on a public Github repository.

**Only one** submission is needed for group work. Please include everyoneâ€™s name and ID in a `README.txt` file.

The `README.txt` file should follow the following template, where ID is your `x.500` ID.

```
Student 1
Name:
ID: 

Student 2
Name:
ID: 

Student 3
Name:
ID: 
```

Zip all four files (`p1.sql` `p2.sql` `p3.sql` and `README.txt`) into one zip file with the following command. You need to have all four files in the same directory and run the command in that directory. Remember to replace `<x.500>` with your `x.500` ID. This ID can be anyone who submits the work for the group. 

<pre><code>zip &#60;x.500&#62;.zip README.txt p1.sql p2.sql p3.sql</code></pre>

This command generates a zip file named `<x.500>.zip`. Submit this file to Gradescope.
